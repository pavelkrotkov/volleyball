## NEQ 2025 Phila PA Notes

1. Receiving the Ball – Begin moving at the moment of the hit, predicting where the ball will fall. Hitting the ball upward more than forward indicates a poorly chosen position; retreat in advance if the ball is heading to the back line.
2. Serving Concentration – There is a lack of muscle memory during serves, so develop a mental routine and repeat it before each serve.
3. Team Interaction – Only one player should call "mine," discuss beforehand who's covering the seams. Position on court often leaves a gap between the net and the back players. Players need to step forward and cover for those at the net when the ball is played on their side of the court.
4. Team Timeout Routine – Develop a team routine for timeouts. For example, holding hands together.
5. Spatial Awareness – Use your peripheral vision to avoid leaving gaps in the defense. Move into those positions in advance.
6. Passing the ball over the net on the second touch should be rare rather than routine. The setter should let the ball float in the air to set up a spike.
7. Aim spikes into open spaces, not directly at opposing players. At this level, players on the other team also do not move to cover.
8. If your soft hit sends the ball over the net, expect a spike in return. Everyone should move to cover underneath.
9. When under pressure from the opponent, avoid resorting to individual actions—each player should not simply pass the ball over the net but rather try to prolong the play until the ball is set for a spike. Keep the ball in play as a breather and use that time to look for weak spots to spike.
