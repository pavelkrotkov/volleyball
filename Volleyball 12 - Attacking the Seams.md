# Hit Smarter, Not Just Harder: Why Attacking the Seams Wins Points

Okay, you've been playing competitive volleyball for a year, you know how to hit the ball, and you've got a coach pushing you. That's awesome! But are you hitting _smart_? Just blasting the ball isn't always the best way to score, especially if you're aiming right at someone. Let's talk about a smarter way to attack: hitting the seams.

**What are the "Seams"?**

Simple. Think about where the other team stands on defense or serve receive. The "seams" are just the empty spaces _between_ those players. There's also a seam between the players near the sidelines and the sideline itself. It's the open court.

**Why Aim for the Gaps (Seams)?**

Hitting the ball straight at a defender might feel powerful, but guess what? If they're ready, it's often easier for them to pass or dig a ball coming right at them. They just have to react.

But when you hit the ball into a seam – that space _between_ players – things get tricky for the other team. Here’s why:

1. **It Forces Movement:** Defenders have to move sideways to play a ball in the seam. Moving sideways quickly to make a good pass is way harder than just sticking their platform out for a ball right at their chest.
2. **It Causes Confusion:** Who's ball is it? When the ball goes between two players, they might hesitate for a split second, wondering if the other person will take it. That hesitation is often enough for the ball to drop. At your level, players might not always communicate perfectly or know exactly who covers which gap, making seam hits extra effective.
3. **It Exploits Open Space:** Volleyball courts are big! There's a lot of space defenders _aren't_ standing in. Smart hitters see those open spots – the seams, the deep corners – and aim there instead of just hitting at the nearest person.

**Think Like a Point-Scoring Hitter**

Instead of just trying to hit hard, start thinking about _where_ you want the ball to land. Look for those gaps. See where the defenders aren't. Sometimes, looking one way and hitting slightly another way (without messing up your mechanics) can trick defenders even more. Your goal isn't just to hit the ball over; it's to make the defense work as hard as possible, move uncomfortably, and maybe even make a mistake. That's how you score more points.

Hitting the seams isn't about being fancy; it's about being smart and using the whole court to your advantage.
