# Level Up Your Attack: Why Three Touches Wins Games

In competitive volleyball, just getting the ball over the net isn't enough. We want to _attack_ effectively. The standard way, and usually the smartest way, to do this is with three planned touches: **Pass, Set, Hit**. Think of it as your team's basic offensive plan on almost every ball that comes over.

**The Power of the Sequence**

- **Touch 1: The Pass (or Dig):** When the ball comes over (especially a tough serve or hit), the first job is **control**. Get under it, use your platform, and aim to pass it high and towards your setter. A good pass is the foundation – it makes everything else possible.
- **Touch 2: The Set:** This is where the setter shines. They are like the quarterback of the team. Their job is to take that pass and use their hands to put the ball in the _perfect_ spot for a hitter. This means letting the ball float gently into the air, positioning it high, usually near the net, making it easy for the attacker to approach and swing. They need good hands and quick thinking to decide who to set and how.
- **Touch 3: The Attack (Spike):** This is the payoff! Because of the controlled pass and the precise set, the hitter can now jump high, time their swing, and hit the ball hard and strategically into the opponent's court. This is your best chance to score points with power and placement. Following this sequence helps everyone on the team know their job and work together, leading to stronger, more surprising attacks.

**Why Just Bumping it Over on Two is Usually a Mistake**

Sending the ball back over the net on the second touch should be rare, not routine. Why?

1. **You Give Away Control:** A bump over the net is often slow, loopy, and easy for the other team to handle. You're essentially giving them a free pass to start _their_ strong attack.
2. **You Waste Your Chance:** You skip the best part! Without a set and a powerful spike, you lose your opportunity to score aggressively. You're playing defense when you should be attacking.
3. **You Help Them:** An easy ball over the net lets their passer make a perfect pass, their setter make a perfect set, and their hitter smash the ball back at _you_. You've basically set them up to score.

Sure, sometimes a setter might do a quick surprise "dump" on the second touch, but that's a special tactic, not the main plan. Stick to the three-touch plan whenever possible.

**The Setter Makes it Happen**

Remember how important that setter is. They take the first pass – even if it's not perfect – and turn it into a chance to score. Their skill is putting the ball exactly where the hitter needs it, letting it hang or "float" perfectly for the attack. Help your setter by giving them the best pass you can!

**Play Smart, Play Strong**

Using the pass-set-hit sequence consistently is how good teams control the game and score points. Don't take the easy way out by just bumping the ball back. Trust the sequence, trust your teammates, and focus on doing your job within those three touches. That’s how we play smart, aggressive volleyball.
